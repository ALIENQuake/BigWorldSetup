00-EN=Your latest selection - Automatic save created when exiting the application after editing the selection.

[BWP]
01-EN=Kreso's selection - This selection takes a minimalist approach, enhancing the original game content without adding any new NPCs or large expansions or encounters. The AI is not changed, so the difficulty will be the same as the original game.
02-EN=Phlaphee's selection - The emphasis of this selection is to keep the original game at the centre stage by only adding content, kits and npcs that are fitting. Mods that are shifting the interest too much, unbalance the game or would not meet the quality expectations are left out. This also results in dropping encounters since it would shift the interest from adventuring to battles. The prices in shops are altered to be more severe and you may change the kits of Bioware npcs.
03-EN=MicBaldur's selection - You want to have all content that fits in the Big World without game-breaking bugs, total rule makeovers or annoying time consuming talks? Then this may be the choice for you. Since this includes better AI (BP is preferred over SCS here) and encounters, you might notice the increased difficulty level as you progress through the game. In an approach to fit the taste of female players, a few mods that alter male npcs and so on were added.
04-EN=Leonardo's selection - This is a selection recommended by Leonardo Watson, the creator and maintainer of the BiG World Project installation guide and BGT translation project. Since this includes Ascension and better AI (SCS is preferred over BP here), you might notice the increased difficulty level as you progress through the game. This also includes Infinity Animations.
