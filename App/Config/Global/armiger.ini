[Description]
Mod-EN=The Armiger is a specialist of defensive fighting style with improved Armour Class and abilities, which relies on counterattacks. Also he has unique HLA ability.||While other warriors rely on speed or canny parries to defend themselves, the armiger trusts in his armor. Armigers create their own protective gear and improve it over time. They can stand before dozens of opponents, confident that their armor will shield them from harm.
