[Description]
Mod-EN=White-as-Bones is a chaotic neutral human male barbarian. Being a 2nd-Level character, he's available almost from the very beginning of the game.||The mod includes banters between White and all BioWare NPCs. All players may experience some friend talks. What's more, White may start to romance male characters of any race. If you're not interested, just tell him.
