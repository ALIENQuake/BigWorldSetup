[Description]
Mod-EN=The fabulous Aurora from Aurora's Shoes & Boots can now join you on your quest in ToB!||When asked about her life, Aurora tells you that she grew up in Athkatla as the daughter of a minor merchant. She often traveled with her father's caravans when she was young, learning swordplay from anyone who would teach her and gaining a love of adventure. As soon as she could, she joined a group of adventurers and set out to try her luck.||Her love of adventure is matched only by her love for shoes. During her travels along the Sword Coast she amassed an enormous collection. Upon retirement, she opened the store to share her passion with other keen-eyed collectors.
