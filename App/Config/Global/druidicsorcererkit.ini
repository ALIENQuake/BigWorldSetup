[Description]
Mod-EN=This kit offers a uniquely powerful magic-user player class. It combines certain abilities of the druid and the sorcerer. The Druidic Sorcerer is undeniably the most powerful class that you can play, but you will have to work for that power. This kit gives an interesting play experience while preventing it from becoming ridiculously powerful.
