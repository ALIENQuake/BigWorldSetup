[Description]
Mod-EN=This is one of three of Macholy's mods which aim to make the game more realistic. This mod adds a new system that determines the behavior between the main character and party members.|For example: According to the the value of relationship your teammate's behavior will be affected when he isn't in your team. He may fight for you when he saw you are in a battle, give you a treatment or other help when needed, does nothing or attack you.|Many original enemies in BG would ask their ally for help. Now, if the value of relationship between an enemy's ally and you is high enough, then he wouldn't help his ally to attack you.|There is also included an upgrade for the behavior of dragons, animal teammates, beholders and much more.|The value of relationship will quantified by several parameters: experience during beeing in the team, protagonist's charm and alignment, the teammate's personal mission, core skills and special items.
