[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod adjusts some items to have powers that make better sense or fit into the games world.||Example:|- Thief can now use light crossbows.|- Selune's Promise is now only usable by clerics.|- Hellpick, according to its description was used to kill drow wizards. It seems logical to me that the weapon should have bonus against mages. Therefore, +5 damage vs mages.
