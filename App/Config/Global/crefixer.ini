Tra=0

[Description]
Mod-EN=Some macros designed to fix any slot bugs introduced by other mods. This mod solves the same problem as the Creature Inventory Overhauler component of Lollorian's Lolfixer (the game crashes when creatures have invalid item combinations equipped, for example a 2H sword with a shield at the same time), but this mod deletes such items while the Overhauler moves such items to inventory so no content is lost. Either solution works, so you may choose which one you prefer.
