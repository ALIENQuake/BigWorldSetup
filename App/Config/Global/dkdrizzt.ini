[Description]
Mod-EN=With this mod you can take Drizzt Do'Urden into your group, when you leave the Underdark and go again into the town. You can summon the magic cat Guenhwyvar with "K" which attacks enemies then automatically. Not together with with "Region of Terror" because this mod adds likewise Drizzt and both are contentwise not compatible. The component with the Artemis Entreri encounter of "Unfinished Business" is compatible with this Drizzt-Mod. If Valen is in the party, it is actually not possible to take in Drizzt, because he becomes hostile immediately.
