[Description]
Mod-EN=The Tempests are group of warriors that have an innate ability to control lightning. Through their training, they specialize in fighting with two swords, strike hard and fast, learn devastating lightning based attacks, and are deadly foes. However, their fighting style only lets them wear studded leather armour, and the containment of their powers is taxing on their bodies.
