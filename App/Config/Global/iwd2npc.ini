[Description]
Mod-EN=The main goal of IWD2 NPC is to give an IWD2 player the opportunity to play with joinable NPCs that are not silent.||The mod is rated M, for coarse language and adult situations. You can go to T rating if you exclude Salomeya and Sir Wind Nord from the party and tell the eligible characters that you are not interested in their romantic advances.||You can either select a pre-created group or create your own pc and import the other guys, but if you do, make sure to take the given names and corresponding soundsets.
