[Description]
Mod-EN=A tribute to the manga "Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life"|The mod adds an underground city (entrance in the room with the lich in the gate area) and a doze of new items. Those who do not bother because the mod is unconnected with BG, will find some extremely challenging battles and finally the manga character Tomoyo.||Warning! This mod needs to be downloaded manually.
