[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod complements the extended night areas that are missing from all main areas except Baldur's Gate and adds the missing night minimaps to all main areas. It also fixes around ninety percent of the visual stupidities in Baldur's Gate city. These ranged from windows showing at night and not in the day (or vice versa) to whole buildings that changed from nicely maintained habitations during the day to complete derelicts as the sun went down. It gives all of the wall braziers their missing flames. Finally, almost all of the nasty blue and purple patches have been removed from the streets. WARNING The .wed files are irreparably corrupted.
