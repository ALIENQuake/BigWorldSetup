[Description]
Mod-EN=Aid a nation of elves with an invasion into their holy burial grounds. This mod is meant to be a small sample battlefield, as a precursor of what is to come in Silmarillion. The challenge starts somewhere in the Government District of Athkatla. It is a pure tactical mod, teleporting you to a continuous battle against wave after wave of enemies and then teleporting you back at the end. There is no special reward.||Warning: If the battlefield get too crowded, scripts may not fire correctly. If you can keep the number of living enemies low at all times, chances are that you can complete the mod, otherwise you may get stuck and need to set some Global via CLUAConsole to advance.
