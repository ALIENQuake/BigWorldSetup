[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod introduces a variety of Hidden Kits that are made available under certain conditions. Typically all of them are obtainable by Dual-Classing at level 12, from either a Fighter, Mage, or Cleric. The amount of XP required to achieve the Hidden Kit is considerable, but so are the advantages gained. Note that certain Basic Stats are still required to successfully Dual-Class.||Apart from a few standard advantages and disadvantages within the Kit itself, most notably present in ALL the Hidden Kits is the ability to increase your INACTIVE Class by one level every time you level up. This advantage enables to effectively gain a multi-class character on the rate of a single-class character.
