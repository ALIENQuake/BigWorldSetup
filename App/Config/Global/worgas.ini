[Description]
Mod-EN=Worgas is an elven chaotic emotionally shattered wildmage with high intelligence which is hidden behind his neurotic behaviour. He often speaks in riddles impossible to understand. He restlessly wanders with a levitating eyeball with many eyes on it. He has two unique abilities called Wail of Insanity and Biting Eye. Worgas NPC is not compatible with mods, which introduces Drizzt and/or Artemis, too.
