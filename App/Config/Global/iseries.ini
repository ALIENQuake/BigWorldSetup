[Description]
Mod-EN=The iSeries is a set of very beta versions of my scripts for Icewind Dale II.|So far the scripts only use a limited number of spells. Otherwise they appear to do most of the other things the eSeries was designed to do: Threat Level Assessment, Weapon Switching, Move to Combat, and a few other things. They're NOT going to be able to strut their stuff with a high level party.||Use iBard for Bards, iArcher for Mages, and iFighter for Fighter types or Cleric types.
