                Beamdog packaged the Siege of Dragonspear expansion on Steam and GoG in a way that breaks mod support. If you downloaded
                Siege of Dragonspear directly from the Beamdog website, this does not apply to you. If you have the Steam
                or GoG edition of Siege of Dragonspear installed, run the following tool (only needs to be used once) to
                reorganize the game files before using BWS:

                Sometimes you need to overwrite mod files AFTER extraction but BEFORE installation of the mod itself and BEFORE "Big World
                Fixpack" fixes processing.</br>
                In such case you can put any custom mod files using exactly the same folder structure, inside correct game top folder to
                avoid pausing installation and manual copying.

                This way you can actually select the mods clicking in the
                <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>. Make sure you run the BWS before you do so, since the automatic updates at the beginning may
                ruin your work otherwise. (Or stay offline while starting the BWS.)
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want to remove some parts of a fixed mod, you may also want to add a line with NotFixed=X to the mods section. This
                will remove the fixed flag from those components. So you want to get rid of component 3 and 10? This is your
                line:

            </p>
            <pre class="code ini"><span class="re1">NotFixed</span><span class="sy0">=</span><span class="re2"><span class="nu0">3</span> 10.</span></pre>
            <p>
                Another option is to edit the App\Config\User.ini to fit your needs after it was written. (Shortly after you
                selected how to handle failures during download, extraction and installation.) You can do that until the
                mods get installed. Use the pause-button or force the issue like described in the next block.

                The last column shows if this is preselected for recommended, standard, tactic or expert-installations. In this case, the

                MUC are multiple choice-selections. The component-column starts with a select-line to create a new sub-menu. Underneath are
                the components that are choose-able. Pay attention that only one component can be and actually is selected

                SUB are sub-components. The component-column starts with the component that has this subs. The next lines start with the
                same component, then a question-mark and the number of the question. After the underline there is the answer
                that is given.
                <br/> So the answer 6 to the third question of component 67 would be 67?3_6.
                <br/> Pay attention that only one component of each question is selected.

                Used to start and stop adding components to a group which is installed in one go. Putting this into the InstallOrder.ini by yourself
                is only useful if WeiDU would grab too much memory (if it installed many components in one go) or the WeiDU-code
                requires you to do so. Installation of SUBs is not allowed. This is used automatically if you chose to install
                in batch-mode to speed up the installation.
            </p>
            <p>

                The translations are placed in the WeiDU-XX.ini. If you have an English translation, go with EN, Russian with RU and so on.

            <p>
                The name of each [section] is the setups name. As you might guess, the lines beginning with the @ are translations for the
                mods component 0 and 1. It is the text that is displayed in the WeiDU.log. You might want to shorten very
                long texts so you don&#039;t have to scroll so much in the selection-screen. If you wish extended / more
                detailed information, add a line with an
                <strong>E</strong> at the beginning instead of the
                <strong>@</strong>.
                <strong>Tra</strong> contains the number that WeiDU uses for that translation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that you have to edit the Mod.ini if you did not find an existing section and added a new translation for a mod.
            </p>
            <p>Note that subcomponents are not listed in the WeiDU.log but are required to install the correct component. If
                you install a component with subcomponents, it may result in a question like this:</p>
            <pre class="text code text" style="font-family:monospace;">

                files (like sound-files). Additional files have an ADD-prefix, language-files an XX-Add-prefix, where XX
                can be replace by the language-token (like IT for Italy).
                <br/> Set one or all of these values to Manual if the mod is embedded in another one or does not have a homepage...
                <br/> Additional archives may also have a
                <strong>Test</strong>-key. The following will be "OK" if the file Kiara-Zaiya\Sounds\KHappy.ogg exists. Its file-size
                may be of any value. If you want a specific value, you can also set that. But if the files are changed, you
                may end up with some false positives.

                The value of the Save- and Size-keys are updated during downloads and link-checks. If fetching these values via the

            <p>
                <strong>NotFixed</strong>-keys are used to remove the fixed-flag from components of a fixed mod. Eg.

                The available translations are listed in the
                <strong>Tra</strong>-key. These are substantial for the BWS:
                <br/> It is used to show the mods in the selection-screen or avoid installing them if the desired language-token
                is missing. Later during the installation, WeiDU gets the number for its language-parameter. If a mod does
                not contain on-screen-text, use - to link all the missing translations to the following number. In our example,
                Korean users will install the English one.
            </p>

            <p>
                You might have noticed that there's still no description for the mod. This is put into the Mod-XX.ini. It was put into different
                files so characters would not be corrupted when editing withanother codepage.

                the value of the
                <strong>DownloadOnly</strong>- or

                *Mods in an area are not treated as conflicts. *Mods can have conflicts in groups. So if two combined mods

                    <p>
                        Every time the BWS is asked to check for a link, it will fetch the file-name and the size of the file provided by this
                        <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>. This way it verifies that the download is available during the link-check (right after
                        you started the installation) and during the download-process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By comparing the current information to the files that may exist in the download-folder, it determines if a download is needed
                        or if the file from the internet is the same as the local copy. If the size of the download is null,
                        the first few bytes will be loaded to see if the file is a website or a real file. This is useful
                        for some sites. If the size is 0 but a real file exists, the currently available data (size) will
                        be taken as a given.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the file does not exist, the BWS checks for a new download-location (for this one only) by looking through the link-updates.
                        If a new one is found, it will try anew. Otherwise the download will count as failed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These checks are made with wget,which loads the http-header of the URLs to determine the correct values. If that fails for
                        some reason, AutoIt3s internal function to at least get the size will be used.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The download itself will be made with wget. The main reason for that is the capability of fetching and resume downloads.
                        So if your data-line is a bit unstable or you get disconnected, the wget-utility will still try to
                        fetch the rest of the file another 2 times. Resuming a download will also work if you did download
                        a part of a file with the BWS and the file on the internet did not change since then. It will not
                        work if you throw in some partial downloads that the BWS did not log itself. Those are deleted before
                        a download is started. This is because some files are named the same even if the version has changed
                        and we don&#039;t want to have 50
                        <acronym title="Megabyte">MB</acronym> of version A and 40 of version B.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To speed up the download-process, the BWS uses download-queues that manage up to five downloads simultaneously. You can choose
                        to halt and pause or stop downloads one by one or all if you like to.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After all files are downloaded, the files are compared another time to see if everything went fine. If not, the missing ones
                        are listed with those components/mods that depend on those and will fail to install later. You can
                        either choose to try and reload the missing mods, provide them yourself or continue without those
                        missing mods. If substantial files are missing, you can not do that. Providing a file means either
                        that you use a file-selector and search for the mod on your hard-disk or get the download-
                        <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> opened in your default-browser so you can try to fetch the file for yourself. If you
                        select them, you may even force the BWS to use the file if it differs from the expected values.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Missing files and components with open dependencies will be removed from further action and added to a list of files that
                        will be displayed after the installation is finished as a reminder (to show what&#039;s missing).
                    </p>

                </h1>
                <div class="level1">

                    <p>
                        All the files that are required by the mods that were selected and downloaded are processed. It is checked if the file is
                        a package create by INNO or NSIS installers. Those are handled by passing some parameters so the
                        install correctly. NSIS installers come with this "Do you want to install" message-box which cannot
                        be suppressed, so to avoid annoying popups, those are put at the end of the extraction-process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Other files are extracted by 7zip, which unpacks the files into the installation-folder. All existing files are overwritten.
                        After that, the BWS will look for the tp2-file and the mods directory. (Or other files that should
                        exist now if the package does not contain a WeiDU-installer.) If they are not found, potential sub-folders
                        are searched for them. If found, the content is moved, otherwise archives that were put into the
                        current one are unpacked afterwards.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the check for the mod-files still fails, the package is added to the list of faulty extractions. That means NSIS-packages
                        are add, too. If a mod has some addon-packages (e.g. for fixing or providing sound-files) and the
                        main-package is not extracted properly, the addons will also be added to this list.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After this procedure is done with all files, the NSIS-installers are executed. They are started with a parameter so they
                        are extracted to a sub-directory named NSIS in your installation-folder. This leaves only the message-box
                        open, which may or may not be closed automatically. The BWS tries to do that, but it still may fail
                        and you have to do that manually. The mods are not installed into the main-folder because the installer
                        will open the WeiDU-installer and try to install it&#039;s mod automatically. To prevent an installation
                        at that time - which will mess up the order in which mods should be installed - this little trick
                        is used (WeiDU will fail to find the game and stop). The WeiDU-instance will be closed and the next
                        package is searched. Please note that all NSIS-installers are executed - there is no check if the
                        installer was actually from a mod you selected or maybe exists due to another reason. This is on
                        purpose so the maintenance does not have to keep track on the package-format.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After that, the files are checked another time and the mods that were put in NSIS-installers are recognized. Special extractions
                        like InfinityAnimations content are also done here. When some mods had errors during the extraction,
                        the BWS removes the key-files. If it finds them later, one can assume that the user extracted them
                        correctly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After that missing files and mods that depend on them are reported and you can either choose to test these files, provide
                        them yourself (by either download or extraction) or remove them all from your installation. This
                        will not work if substantial mods are involved. If you want to extract them yourself, the files are
                        executed and your default program for extractions will be launched.

                        if those should be executed. If already installed, the component will be skipped. If the dependencies
                        are met and conflicts don&#039;t exist the component will be installed. Otherwise you can select
                        to either give it a try or skip that installation.

                    <p>
                        After WeiDU finished the installation it is checked if it was a successful one. This is done by checking the WeiDU.log and
                        the debug-file. This way, errors and warnings can be found. Depending on the selection of the installation-logic,
                        the installation will be paused on warnings and/or errors. You can either try to give it another
                        try or continue.

                    <p>
                        On errors, mods that depend on the current component are listed and removed if you skip the installation. If substantial
                        mods are not installed, skipping will be forbidden. Skipped components will be added to the list
                        of selected but missing components. It will be displayed at the end of the installation.

                        To help debugging some errors, a file called BWS-Debug.7z will be created that includes a slightly stripped version

                <p>To see some entries in the selection-view of the BWS. we still need to populate the InstallOrder.ini. The syntax
                    would be:
                    <pre class="text code text" style="font-family:monospace;">type of line;setups name;component number;corresponding number for the components theme;install with pre-selections (<b>R</b>ecommended,<b>S</b>tandard,<b>T</b>actic,<b>E</b>xpert);[optional dependency: if a component could be installed in two places depending on the selection, run a check if it should be installed "now".]</pre>
                    <pre class="text code text" style="font-family:monospace;">STD;bgqe;0;03;1111;</pre>
                    <p>This is a standard component, thus STD. BGQE is the setups name. The only available component number
                        is 0. The theme number 03 tells us the components theme would be "BG1 Quest Mods". As you can see,
                        we install this component with all pre-selections.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
                            <a href="#manage_conflicts_and_dependencies">Game.ini</a>
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>If the mod does not depend on or conflict with others, you don't have to edit this file. Since the BGQE
                        mod should not be displayed when BGT is not installed (if BG1 is not available), you have to put
                        the mod in the [Purge]-section, too. That way, the mod will be purged if the dependency BGT is not
                        meet. You usually just add the mod to existing lines if you know about that BGT-dependency. The option
                        in the [connections]-section will ask you to install BGQE if you enabled NSCPortraits component 300
                        (and BGQE is not enabled yet).
