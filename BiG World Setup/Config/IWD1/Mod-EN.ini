[Description]
1pp=Without a doubt the most comprehensive mod when it comes to post-release QA and visuals, 1pp has been a growing work of love for close to 8 years with the aim of providing a refined, polished experience with attention to detail that many felt was lacking in some aspects of Baldur's Gate II compared to its predecessor. ||1ppv4 represents the culmination of this effort, bringing together the various previously disjointed graphical and mechanical tweaks and components that have accumulated over the years and many more besides; updated, streamlined and in the form of one coherent installer.
1pp_hq_music_iwd=This mod replaces the existing music of the game with one of a better quality.|The soundtrack itself is the same, but it should sound better (44.100 compared to 22.020 kHz).
1pp_iwd_fixes=This mod allows you to do any combination of three things:||- Fix broken character attack animation sounds in TotLM|- Restore combat stance animations in Icewind Dale|- Use IWD/BG1 (legacy) character animations in HoW/TotLM
ab=Auril's Bane is a Mod for Icewind Dale that adds new features, quest, items, and spells, and more to make your regular game more fun and exciting. ||The HoW-version does contain less content than the TotLM version.
ab_how=This is the download for the HoW-version
ab_totlm=This is the download for the TotLM-version
difftweak=This mod allows you to change item stacking, enemies HPs, AC, Saves and Thac0 plus some other tweaks. It allows you to set how much you want to change it.
fullplate=This mod is one big rework of the armour system of IWD. Light, enchanted armours actually help you dodge. Heavy, enchanted armours don't help dodging much, but they absorb perhaps half or more of an blow in exchange for slowing you down and fatiguing you.|Stealth, thieving and casting in heavy armour is possible, but difficult.
g3daletweaks=This is a collection of tweaks that have been assembled for Icewind Dale.||It is a compilation of cosmetic changes, and tweaks. Some of these were fan requests, others simply make dealing with the more irritating aspects of the game engine easier.
generalized_biffing=This WeiDU mod allows you to biff the content of the override folder for improved performance, that means the files are converted into the BIF file format and moved into the data folder. The game thereby loads much faster again and the performance is running pretty smoothly without jerking. It is compatible with the common WeiDU stack uninstall operation.
improvedbams=A large number of the Baldur's Gate inventory graphics (BAMs) were improved for the sequel, so this small pack puts them back into the original.|It will also work with Icewind Dale, as that re-uses many BG items.
improvements-iwd=Thes tweaks may make the game behave a bit more like IWD2.
iu_iwd=The Item Upgrade for Icewind Dale mod is a modest collection of upgrades for various items throughout the game.||Reading through the item descriptions, the developers really took a lot of time to give many items an elaborate backstory. In many cases, I felt that an upgrade was a chance to tell a bit more of the story.
iwdfixpack=The Icewind Dale Fixpack is designed to fix several bugs and errors that remain in the game after the official patches have been applied. It works with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster installed. In fact, many issues quietly fixed by Heart of Winter or Trials of the Luremaster have been rolled back to every version of the game.||This also includes a component to update game text.
iwdnpc=The mod introduces a cast of five new characters to the great frozen wastes of the Forgotten Realms, with all the depth you would expect from companions. The mod will transform the Icewind Dale experience into the story of a single, player-defined protagonist, and his or her fully-interactive allies. ||The NPCs include a fighter, ranger, multi-classed thief, paladin, and bard. Alternate classes are also available. Each character comes with a new, original portrait, full voicing, interactions with the PC and each other, and quest commentary and interjections. Romance is also in the bitterly cold air... ||To start playing, you will have to install the mod, create your protagonist in the first slot, and import your companions alongside. Make sure to choose correct soundsets for them.
mixmod=This is a small collection of different tweaks which some were already done before, but here these give more setting possibilities to the user. Many components determine similar already available components from other mods. These are not installed immediately, but you are requested to check them on the screen.
redrake_s_iwd_fixpack=This mod adjusts some items to have powers that make better sense or fit into the games world.||Example:|- Thief can now use light crossbows.|- Selune's Promise is now only usable by clerics.|- Hellpick, according to its description was used to kill drow wizards. It seems logical to me that the weapon should have bonus against mages. Therefore, +5 damage vs mages.
textpack=Fanmade Russian textupdates for some IWD mods.
ub_iwd=Like its predecessors for Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, Unfinished Business for Icewind Dale aims to restore content and quests that were omitted from the game as shipped. The additional content in this mod is based on what can be piece together from various game resources and from talks with a former developer.
weidu=WeiDU is needed for the installation and the recent WeiDU.exe must always be placed in the BG2 main directory.
widescreen=This mod allows you to play the game at any desired resolution. It can currently set your resolution to any X by Y, with X >= 800 and Y >= 600. Non-standard resolutions (E.G. 801 by 632) are not supported in fullscreen, but can work in windowed mode. BG cannot be forced to be windowed, but can work at all X by Y, with X >= 640 and Y >= 480.
