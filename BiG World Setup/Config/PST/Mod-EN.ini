[Description]
1pp_hq_music_pst=This mod replaces the existing music of the game with one of a better quality.|The soundtrack itself is the same, but it should sound better (44.100 compared to 22.020 kHz).
generalized_biffing=This WeiDU mod allows you to biff the content of the override folder for improved performance, that means the files are converted into the BIF file format and moved into the data folder. The game thereby loads much faster again and the performance is running pretty smoothly without jerking. It is compatible with the common WeiDU stack uninstall operation.
ghostdog's-pst-ui=This mod adjusts the user interface elements to fit to the bigger resolutions that you can get by using the widescreen mod.|Without that mod, all elements would be in the upper left corner.|Additionally, bigger fonts are available to improve readability.
mixmod=This is a small collection of different tweaks which some were already done before, but here these give more setting possibilities to the user. Many components determine similar already available components from other mods. These are not installed immediately, but you are requested to check them on the screen.
pst-drawfix=This mod fixes the problem that PST is dog-slow when played using Windows 8 and also keeps the mouse cursor from moving in circles by another fix.
pst-fix=This Fixpack fixes, in a clean and compatibility-friendly WeiDU format, all of the bugs fixed by the three major non-WeiDU Fixpacks available for PS:T to date, namely: Platter's Fixpack, Restoration Pack and SKARDAVNELNATE's All Inclusive Fixpack.||In addition this Fixpack provides fixes to well over 200 additional documented bugs - some rather major - not fixed elsewhere before, plus roughly 4,000 corrections to spelling, grammar and punctuation errors within the dialogue file.
psttp=A language patch for Planescape: Torment on the basis of ZenJu, whose patch corrects about 700 spelling errors.|This patch was ported into WeiDU format by White Agnus, which has its benefit during the installation.
pst-tweak=This mod adds a few ease-of-use tweaks to your Planescape: Torment install.
pst-ub=This mod takes the almost-but-not-quite-finished content that shipped with Black Isle's classic Planescape: Torment, and finishes and polishes it so you can actually see and enjoy the new content in your game. It contains some banter (partly with voicing), additional background informations, items and some quests.||The material and dialogues here will be within the spirit and style of the original game since they were mostly created by the developers of the game while the mod does the finishing touches.
textpack=Fanmade Russian textupdates for some IWD mods.
weidu=WeiDU is needed for the installation and the recent WeiDU.exe must always be placed in the BG2 main directory.
widescreen=This mod allows you to play the game at any desired resolution. It can currently set your resolution to any X by Y, with X >= 800 and Y >= 600. Non-standard resolutions (E.G. 801 by 632) are not supported in fullscreen, but can work in windowed mode. BG cannot be forced to be windowed, but can work at all X by Y, with X >= 640 and Y >= 480.
