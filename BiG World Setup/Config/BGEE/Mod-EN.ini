[Description]
bg2_tweaks=This is a compilation of cosmetic changes and tweaks.
bgee_fixpack=This is a small collection of fixes for bugs existing in BG:EE v2014.
bgeear=This mod is an armor pack. There is a dwarf, Kurtz Goldenaxe, who is outside of the Friendly Arm Inn who will sell you these armors. Some of the armors are color variations of what you find in the game and some of them are new. The magical armors are expensive so you will have to save a lot of gold to buy them.
bgeeclassicmovies=This is mini-mod that restores the classic movies from the original Baldur’s Gate and selected movies from Baldur’s Gate II to Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition. The classic movies have been resized to the same dimensions as the new BG:EE movies (1280x720) while maintaining their aspect ratios.
bgeew=This mod is an weapon pack. There is a dwarf, Maltz, located outside of the Friendly Arm Inn who will sell you these weapons. Some of the weapons are color variations of what you find in the game, some from BG2 and some of them are new. The magical weapons are expensive so you will have to save a lot of gold to buy them.
bpseries=This mod adds more AI scripts for your party-members. The new scripts analyze the opponent and handle fights based on that outcome. By using hotkeys you can toggle the usage of buffs/summons, items, ranged/melee weapons, thieving skills and so on.
convinientammunition=This is a small mod that adds a three quivers (with basic/normal ammunition) and a ammo belt to Taerum's shop (smith) in Beregost.
eekeeper=This is the ee-adaption of the Shadowkeeper (a save-game editor, creature-, item- and spell-browser).
generalized_biffing=This WeiDU mod allows you to biff the content of the override folder for improved performance, that means the files are converted into the BIF file format and moved into the data folder. The game thereby loads much faster again and the performance is running pretty smoothly without jerking. It is compatible with the common WeiDU stack uninstall operation.
isra=Isra is a follower of Sune Firehair, the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, and the only chaotic aligned deity to sponsor paladins. As such, she isn't necessarily what you might expect of a paladin. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though).||You can find her in the Nashkel Mines region, trying (with no success whatsoever) to resolve Prism's legal difficulties.
jklhel=Helarine, the Doomguide of Kelemvor NPC Cleric can be found in the Friendly Arm Inn. She has her own kit, friendship talk, plot-reactions and banters with some other NPCs.
karatur=A monk offers a quest at the Fiendly Arm Inn. In the process, you'll receive a unique leveling relic, experience a tough, challenging battle and you'll be rewarded with a store from Kara-Tur.
kitpack=This is a collection of several kits, adding to the selection of fighters, rangers, paladins, clerics, druids, thieves or bards.
mixmod=This is a small collection of different tweaks which some were already done before, but here these give more setting possibilities to the user. Many components determine similar already available components from other mods. These are not installed immediately, but you are requested to check them on the screen.
neera=The Neera Expansion mod adds a series of dialogues to the lovely elven wild mage Neera, in an effort to help flesh out her personality. For the romantically inclined, it also adds a number of flirts that you can initiate if you talk to her.
paintbg=PaintBG is a mod that makes original artwork by artastrophe available for PC portraits.
rr=This mod re-balances the bards and thieves and gives them new abilities.
scionmod=Rather than devoting themselves to some existing deity, scions reaped the nascent power of Bhaal, the god of murder. As fitting for a spawn of that god, this cleric kit allows the scion to use any one handed melee weapon and backstab as a thief of the same level when hidden.
shaman=Use with coution if you plan to have mages with familiars in your party since it replaces them with a greater panther.||The druid is able to specialize in spears and two-handed weapons. The kit contains an upgraded familiar that levels up as you do. You can also acquire new spears/javelins that are located in several stores.
song_and_silence=This mod enhances the thieves and bards, adds some new kits for both classes and some general fixes.
stratagems=This mod adds challenges, a better AI, NSC management and some more general changes. It features a substantially upgraded general AI (almost all monsters call for help intelligently, choose sensible targets, and use magic items) as well as much better AI for a lot of specific types of creatures (wizards, priests, sirines, basilisks...). It also upgrades enemy challenges in special fights. Per default, only the Tactic-version will install the "Tactical Challenges" components of this mod.
subrace=A wizard waiting outside the Candlekeep Inn is eager to ask you some questions and thereby expose your ancestry by casting the Spell of Origins. Depending on you race you started the game with, you'll be able to advance to different ethnic groups of Faerun.
sunsoulmonk=Monks of the Sun Soul Order believe that they each harbor a small fragment of the sun's divine essence, long absent from the Realms and are trained to tap into the "spiritual light" within and manifest it externally, using fire-fists and sunray. Their training does provide some drawbacks to their melee capabilities.
sword_and_fist=This mod adds some fighter kits.
tiger=The monk masters a style that concentrates on unleashing the fierceness of the fighter in a nearly uncontrolled fashion by using the monks Chi. The wisdom required to master Chi to this high of a level reduces the monks overall physical prowess, which he more than makes up for with his spell-like abilities. It is also the only martial arts style in the Relams that actively makes use of weapons in its training, so he can gain grand mastery in quarterstaffs.
valerie=With tensions rising between Baldur's Gate and Amn, and rumors of unnatural disasters plaguing Amnish territory on the Sword Coast, a young Cowled Wizard has taken it upon herself to learn the truth of the matter. Adventurers willing to work with a Cowled Wizard will find a willing ally in their Nashkel investigations and beyond.| |This mod includes a friendship with flirtation opportunities, banters, interjections and comments on the world of Baldur's Gate.
w_packmule=This mod adds a pack mule to the game. It will follow your party around and carry your equipment for you. You can buy the mule from a guy named Stedd, who can be found in the courtyard of the Friendly Arm Inn.
w_psionics_unleashed=Psionics Unleashed is a mod that aims to add a fully functional psionic system and psionic character classes based on 3.5 ed. Dungeons & Dragons. Because of the nature of the Infinity Engine and because Baldur's Gate games are based on the 2nd ed. of AD&D, this reproduction couldn't be 100% faithful and some compromises had to be made along the way.
weidu=WeiDU is needed for the installation and the recent WeiDU.exe must always be placed in the BG2 main directory.
white=White-as-Bones is a chaotic neutral human male barbarian. Being a 2nd-Level character, he's available almost from the very beginning of the game.||The mod includes banters between White and all BioWare NPCs. All players may experience some friend talks. What's more, White may start to romance male characters of any race. If you're not interested, just tell him.
wmart=Deidre and Joluv, the bonus merchants from the second part of the series, make a stop in Baldur's Gate before they head to Amn. These merchants bring along their treasure trove of goods from the far off places they have visited. Their items are exotic, magical, expensive and likely overpowered.
xanbg1friend=This mod provides a friendship path for Xan NPC.
