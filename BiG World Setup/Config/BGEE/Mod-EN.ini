ajantisportraitpackee=The Mod gives a choice of custom portraits for Ajantis.
animus=Animus is a sentient weapon capable of conversing telepathically with you and you alone. Unlike Lilarcor, Animus is reasonably intelligent and capable of holding an actual conversation-although since it's a telepathic weapon he's incapable of speaking in-battle like Lilarcor. It's normally a +1 weapon with no special benefits, but once you discover a little more about your heritage, it can be upgraded to a +2 longsword with a couple of extra benefits at the cost of it's ability to converse. Animus can be found in the Nashkel general store for a reasonable fee.
aTweaks=This mod is just a small collection of various gameplay tweaks and changes.
bg2_tweaks=This is a compilation of fixes, cosmetic changes, and tweaks.

Some of the armors are color variations of what you find in the game and some of them are new. The magical armors are expensive so you will have to save a lot of gold to buy them.
bgeeclassicmovies=This is mini-mod that restores the classic movies from the original Baldur’s Gate and selected movies from Baldur’s Gate II to Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition. The classic movies have been resized to the same dimensions as the new BG:EE movies (1280x720) while maintaining their aspect ratios.
bgeew=This mod is an weapon pack. There is a dwarf, Maltz, located outside of the Friendly Arm Inn who will sell you these weapons. Some of the weapons are color variations of what you find in the game, some from BG2 and some of them are new. The magical weapons are expensive so you will have to save a lot of gold to buy them.
bgeegraphics=This mod complements the extended night areas that are missing from all main areas except Baldur's Gate and adds the missing night minimaps to all main areas. It also fixes around ninety percent of the visual stupidities in Baldur's Gate city. These ranged from windows showing at night and not in the day (or vice versa) to whole buildings that changed from nicely maintained habitations during the day to complete derelicts as the sun went down. It gives all of the wall braziers their missing flames. Finally, almost all of the nasty blue and purple patches have been removed from the streets.
bpseries=This mod adds more AI scripts for your party-members. The new scripts analyze the opponent and handle fights based on that outcome. By using hotkeys you can toggle the usage of buffs/summons, items, ranged/melee weapons, thieving skills and so on.

eekeeper=This is the ee-adaption of the Shadowkeeper (a save-game editor, creature-, item- and spell-browser).
generalized_biffing=This WeiDU mod allows you to biff the content of the override folder for improved performance, that means the files are converted into the BIF file format and moved into the data folder. The game thereby loads much faster again and the performance is running pretty smoothly without jerking. It is compatible with the common WeiDU stack uninstall operation.
isra=Isra is a follower of Sune Firehair, the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, and the only chaotic aligned deity to sponsor paladins. As such, she isn't necessarily what you might expect of a paladin. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though).||You can find her in the Nashkel Mines region, trying (with no success whatsoever) to resolve Prism's legal difficulties.
iwdification=The mod adds various elements such as selectable bard songs, two-handed axes, and over 65 new spells into the Baldur's Gate series of games. Every component can be installed independently of one another.

kitpack=This is a collection of several kits, adding to the selection of fighters, rangers, paladins, clerics, druids, thieves or bards.
kittomes=In Baldur's Gate 1 originally were no kits. In Baldur's Gate 2, characters start out at a later level and can have a kit. So if you start a character without a kit in the first game; they gained the kit somehow by the time the second game. This mod adds a merchant, Panver the Loremaster, outside of the Friendly Arm Inn who will sell you magical career tomes that can add a kit to a character.
margarita=Margarita is a young halfling that seems to be traveling the Sword Coast, although it is obvious she isn't quite from around there. She's defensive, quiet, and prone to sarcasm when pushed or confronted. She likes to come off as useless, timid, or otherwise innocent, even if that isn't quite the case. Her main belief is: Honor Thy Employer. She does whatever is in her power to complete her employer's tasks, asks no questions except: "How much will I be paid." She is intelligent enough however to see if her life is endangered, and will not endanger it if she can help it (At this case, the price becomes too high).
msfm=This mod aims to make mages in the game to appear more stylish. For that end it adds mage-specific staffs with ranged attacks and circlets, plus it also tweaks all robes, so that player can choose their look.
neera=The Neera Expansion mod adds a series of dialogues to the lovely elven wild mage Neera, in an effort to help flesh out her personality. For the romantically inclined, it also adds a number of flirts that you can initiate if you talk to her.

shaman=Use with coution if you plan to have mages with familiars in your party since it replaces them with a greater panther.||The druid is able to specialize in spears and two-handed weapons. The kit contains an upgraded familiar that levels up as you do. You can also acquire new spears/javelins that are located in several stores.
SirinesCall=The Mod takes place in the coastal area south of Candlekeep, and involves the lighthouse, the treasure cavern, the sirines dwelling along the beach, and worgs and pirates.
song_and_silence=This mod enhances the thieves and bards, adds some new kits and items for both classes and some general fixes.
stratagems=This mod adds challenges, a better AI, NSC management and some more general changes. It features a substantially upgraded general AI (almost all monsters call for help intelligently, choose sensible targets, and use magic items) as well as much better AI for a lot of specific types of creatures (wizards, priests, sirines, basilisks...). It also upgrades enemy challenges in special fights. Per default, only the Tactic-version will install the "Tactical Challenges" components of this mod.

sword_and_fist=This mod extends the options of the fighters and monks.
tiger=The monk masters a style that concentrates on unleashing the fierceness of the fighter in a nearly uncontrolled fashion by using the monks Chi. The wisdom required to master Chi to this high of a level reduces the monks overall physical prowess, which he more than makes up for with his spell-like abilities. It is also the only martial arts style in the Relams that actively makes use of weapons in its training, so he can gain grand mastery in quarterstaffs.
valerie=With tensions rising between Baldur's Gate and Amn, and rumors of unnatural disasters plaguing Amnish territory on the Sword Coast, a young Cowled Wizard has taken it upon herself to learn the truth of the matter. Adventurers willing to work with a Cowled Wizard will find a willing ally in their Nashkel investigations and beyond.| |This mod includes a friendship with flirtation opportunities, banters, interjections and comments on the world of Baldur's Gate.
w_packmule=This mod adds a pack mule to the game. It will follow your party around and carry your equipment for you. You can buy the mule from a guy named Stedd, who can be found in the courtyard of the Friendly Arm Inn.
w_psionics_unleashed=Psionics Unleashed is a mod that aims to add a fully functional psionic system and psionic character classes based on 3.5 ed. Dungeons & Dragons. Because of the nature of the Infinity Engine and because Baldur's Gate games are based on the 2nd ed. of AD&D, this reproduction couldn't be 100% faithful and some compromises had to be made along the way.
wandcase=This mod adds the wand case to the game. It's may be purchased from Thalantyr at High Hedge.
weidu=WeiDU is needed for the installation and the recent WeiDU.exe must always be placed in the BG2 main directory.

Being a 2nd-Level character, he's available almost from the very beginning of the game.||The mod includes banters between White and all BioWare NPCs. All players may experience some friend talks.

wmart=Deidre and Joluv, the bonus merchants from the second part of the series, make a stop in Baldur's Gate before they head to Amn.
