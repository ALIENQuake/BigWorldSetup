Unlike Lilarcor, Animus is reasonably intelligent and capable of holding an actual conversation-although since it's a telepathic weapon he's incapable of speaking in-battle like Lilarcor. It's normally a +1 weapon with no special benefits, but once you discover a little more about your heritage, it can be upgraded to a +2 longsword with a couple of extra benefits at the cost of it's ability to converse.

bgeegraphics=This mod complements the extended night areas that are missing from all main areas except Baldur's Gate and adds the missing night minimaps to all main areas. It also fixes around ninety percent of the visual stupidities in Baldur's Gate city. These ranged from windows showing at night and not in the day (or vice versa) to whole buildings that changed from nicely maintained habitations during the day to complete derelicts as the sun went down.

Banter with Indira and Mur'Neth custom NPCs, if installed.
garrick_flirt=This mod adds some dialogues for Garrick.
generalized_biffing=This WeiDU mod allows you to biff the content of the override folder for improved performance, that means the files are converted into the BIF file format and moved into the data folder.

indinpc=Indira is a half-elven, lawful good fighter/mage to be found in the Firewine Ruins. She has banters with almost all the BG1 NPCs also with Mur`Neth, if this mod is installed.
isra=Isra is a follower of Sune Firehair, the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, and the only chaotic aligned deity to sponsor paladins. As such, she isn't necessarily what you might expect of a paladin. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though).||You can find her in the Nashkel Mines region, trying (with no success whatsoever) to resolve Prism's legal difficulties.
iwdification=The mod adds various elements such as selectable bard songs, two-handed axes, and over 65 new spells into the Baldur's Gate series of games. Every component can be installed independently of one another.

kittomes=In Baldur's Gate 1 originally were no kits. In Baldur's Gate 2, characters start out at a later level and can have a kit. So if you start a character without a kit in the first game; they gained the kit somehow by the time the second game. This mod adds a merchant, Panver the Loremaster, outside of the Friendly Arm Inn who will sell you magical career tomes that can add a kit to a character.
margarita=Margarita is a young halfling that seems to be traveling the Sword Coast, although it is obvious she isn't quite from around there. She's defensive, quiet, and prone to sarcasm when pushed or confronted. She likes to come off as useless, timid, or otherwise innocent, even if that isn't quite the case. Her main belief is: Honor Thy Employer. She does whatever is in her power to complete her employer's tasks, asks no questions except: "How much will I be paid." She is intelligent enough however to see if her life is endangered, and will not endanger it if she can help it (At this case, the price becomes too high).||Warning! This mod needs to be downloaded manually.

scionmod=Rather than devoting themselves to some existing deity, scions reaped the nascent power of Bhaal, the god of murder. As fitting for a spawn of that god, this cleric kit allows the scion to use any one handed melee weapon and backstab as a thief of the same level when hidden.
shaman=Use with coution if you plan to have mages with familiars in your party since it replaces them with a greater panther.||The druid is able to specialize in spears and two-handed weapons.

sirinescall=The Mod takes place in the coastal area south of Candlekeep, and involves the lighthouse, the treasure cavern, the sirines dwelling along the beach, and worgs and pirates.
sob=This mod is all about improving gameplay. If tweaking a rule makes this specific game more fun, then it's a good tweak, PnP be damned. Consider this mod as a collection of 'house rules' specific to the BG campaign. Every choice has been made with an eye to the particular gameplay mechanics of BG2 and the EEs.
song_and_silence=This mod enhances the thieves and bards, adds some new kits and items for both classes and some general fixes.
stratagems=This mod adds challenges, a better AI, NSC management and some more general changes.

thepicturestandardbgee=This mod provides you with higher resolution pics for NPCS including for some mods. These pics are true lore. I use the tactical BWS, therefore those pics have been updated too. This mod is or should be the picture standard for BGEE. If you find something better, then by all means: use that. But don't fall below this standard. 
tiger=The monk masters a style that concentrates on unleashing the fierceness of the fighter in a nearly uncontrolled fashion by using the monks Chi. The wisdom required to master Chi to this high of a level reduces the monks overall physical prowess, which he more than makes up for with his spell-like abilities. It is also the only martial arts style in the Relams that actively makes use of weapons in its training, so he can gain grand mastery in quarterstaffs.||Warning! This mod needs to be downloaded manually.
valerie=With tensions rising between Baldur's Gate and Amn, and rumors of unnatural disasters plaguing Amnish territory on the Sword Coast, a young Cowled Wizard has taken it upon herself to learn the truth of the matter.

w_psionics_unleashed=Psionics Unleashed is a mod that aims to add a fully functional psionic system and psionic character classes based on 3.5 ed. Dungeons & Dragons. Because of the nature of the Infinity Engine and because Baldur's Gate games are based on the 2nd ed. of AD&D, this reproduction couldn't be 100% faithful and some compromises had to be made along the way.
wandcase=This mod adds the wand case to the game. It's may be purchased from Thalantyr at High Hedge.
wbgtap=Humorous small quests.
weidu=WeiDU is needed for the installation and the recent WeiDU.exe must always be placed in the BG2 main directory.
