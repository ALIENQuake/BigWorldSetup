[Description]
Mod-EN=Are you tired of running through the whole initial dungeon over and over? Not anymore! This mod allows you skip all the boring details of Irenicus' dungeon. You can even collect the items normally found within the dungeon. Just inspect the rubble of the destroyed building on Waukeen's Promenade. As a bonus you will also get some experience and may find a bit of pocket change. "Skip Chateau Irenicus" is meant as an alternative to the (in)famous Dungeon-Be-Gone mod which provides a similar option, but in a way that seriously breaks the fourth wall.||Warning: Many other mods add content to Irenicus' Dungeon including joinable NPCs that will not be available later.
