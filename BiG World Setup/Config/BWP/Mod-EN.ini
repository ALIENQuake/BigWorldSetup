bp=BP balances all mods installed before, contains several smaller mods and includes other improvements also as a unique hostile KI system. If several mods have changed the same objects, these are overpowered. BP compensates this again. The AI of BP and Sword Coast Stratagems works on a different way: BP replaces some scripts from other mods by its own, SCS instead rewrites them.

"Spell Revisions" is trying to "rebalance" spells, while that mod purposely makes them extremely overpowered.
