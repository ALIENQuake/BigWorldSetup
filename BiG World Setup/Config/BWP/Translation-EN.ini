1-L2=Before you go on, here are a few important questions:||Did you install Baldur's Gate 2 (and 1, if you want the biggest possible game) with its add-ons?|Did you select a full installation?|Did you install the official patches?||(ToSC US/UK Patch 5512 if you don't have the SAGA-Box and ToB English Patch version 26498 -- do not install other patches!)||Did you start Baldur's Gate 1, 2 and Throne of Bhaal and saved a game for them?|||Do you have enough free disk-space?|Simple BG2-Modding does not need much space, a recommended installation with BGT needs about 10 GB and the biggest installations around 30 GB.|||Also note the following specifics when using Windows VISTA/7:|An activated "User Account Control (UAC)" can disable the installation.||To switch it off, do this:||Start -> Control Panel (classic view)|-> User Accounts|-> Turn User Account Control on or off|-> Few clicks|-> Restart the computer, and it's done.||After you are done with the installation and have tested if the game is playable, you may enable the UAC again.|||If you did install the games using the default "Program files" folder, this may also be a cause of trouble.|Installing or copying BG2 to a new folder isn't a problem. (like "BiG World\BGII - SoA")|||If you already use Windows 8, it is reported that you'll have trouble if you don't run the BWS with administrator-rights. To do that, open the context-menu of BiG World Setup\Autoit3.exe, select the "run as administrator"-entry and select the BiG World Setup.au3 from the file dialogue. This may also solve issues when patch.exe hangs if you are using Windows 7.|||If you did consider everything, you are set to start.||If not, you should proceed these steps correctly, before you continue.
