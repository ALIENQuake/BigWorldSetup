[Description]
1pp=Without a doubt the most comprehensive mod when it comes to post-release QA and visuals, 1pp has been a growing work of love for close to 8 years with the aim of providing a refined, polished experience with attention to detail that many felt was lacking in some aspects of Baldur's Gate II compared to its predecessor. ||1ppv4 represents the culmination of this effort, bringing together the various previously disjointed graphical and mechanical tweaks and components that have accumulated over the years and many more besides; updated, streamlined and in the form of one coherent installer.
comstore=This mod adds items from Baldur's Gate 2, Icewind Dale and some custom made ones.|You can find Shi'nayne in the Weeping Widow Inn in Targos and she will appear in Kuldahar.
difftweak=This mod allows you to change item stacking, enemies HPs, AC, Saves and Thac0 plus some other tweaks. It allows you to set how much you want to change it.
generalized_biffing=This WeiDU mod allows you to biff the content of the override folder for improved performance, that means the files are converted into the BIF file format and moved into the data folder. The game thereby loads much faster again and the performance is running pretty smoothly without jerking. It is compatible with the common WeiDU stack uninstall operation.
iseries=The iSeries is a set of very beta versions of my scripts for Icewind Dale II.|So far the scripts only use a limited number of spells. Otherwise they appear to do most of the other things the eSeries was designed to do: Threat Level Assessment, Weapon Switching, Move to Combat, and a few other things. They're NOT going to be able to strut their stuff with a high level party.||Use iBard for Bards, iArcher for Mages, and iFighter for Fighter types or Cleric types.
IWD2_sorcerers_fixes=This is a WeiDU-version of Slowdown Fixes by Extremist & Quint and IWD2 Unofficial Item/Spell Patch by Gimble.||It fixes serious slowdowns in some areas and makes some spells act as described.
iwd2-ammo-v1=Add item containers or ammo belt that can contain up to 65535 items.
iwd2-clerics-1d3=This mod adds clerics of LOLTH (head drow goddess), YONDALLA (head halfling goddess), GRUUMSH (head orc god), GARL GLITTERGOLD (head gnome god), MORADIN (head dwarf god), and CORELLON LARETHIAN (head elf god) to the game.
iwd2-ease=The Ease-Of-Use mod is collection of useful modlets and minor changes that make playing IWD2 more bearable.
iwd2npc=The main goal of IWD2 NPC is to give an IWD2 player the opportunity to play with joinable NPCs that are not silent.||The mod is rated M, for coarse language and adult situations. You can go to T rating if you exclude Salomeya and Sir Wind Nord from the party and tell the eligible characters that you are not interested in their romantic advances.||You can either select a pre-created group or create your own pc and import the other guys, but if you do, make sure to take the given names and corresponding soundsets.
iwd2-parties=This mod adds a rogue-only pre-made party to IWD2 so that players have more choices at the start of the game.
iwd2-subraces-beta1=This version incorporates sun and wood elves into the game. ||Before starting a new game you should choose up to 6 subraces (necessary for your current party) among humans, aasimars, tieflings, moon elves, drows, wild elves, sun elves and wood elves (all other subraces will remain the same at the moment). You can change different subrace settings in different games.
iwd2tweaks=This is a collection of tweaks that have been assembled for Icewind Dale II.||It is a compilation of fixes, cosmetic changes, and tweaks. Some of these were fan requests, others are needed fixes, and others simply make dealing with the more irritating aspects of the game engine easier.
los=Light of Selune is a mod that adds a large number of new items, updated items, some converted IWD1 items, some class updates (particularly the Ranger class), somewhat nastier traps, and 4 new merchants (two in Targos, one in the Wandering Village, and one in Kuldahar).
merchant=This mod adds Ribald Barterman as a bonus merchant to IWD2. He sells equipment from BG2 in the same way that BG2 bonus merchants sell equipment from PST or IWD. The equipment is typically half-decent and vastly overpriced. Ribald appears in the Gallaway Trading Post and Conway's Smithy.
mixmod=This is a small collection of different tweaks which some were already done before, but here these give more setting possibilities to the user. Many components determine similar already available components from other mods. These are not installed immediately, but you are requested to check them on the screen.
tactics4iwd2=This is a tactical mod which aims to satisfy people who love challenges.||The purpose of this mod is to make the boring fights in the vanilla game more challenging and more exciting, not to spite players. So all the bosses can be defeated directly without any cheese. This mod will improve the battles from beginning to end. About 90% of the creatures have been enhanced; the enhanced respects are: Stats, Spell Selections, AIs, etc.
targos=This mod changes the opening area in IWD2.||The Town of Targos is now attacked by undead monsters (and some minor goblins). It is still designed for Level 1 Parties, but it is no longer a walk in the park. In addition, this mod allows you to complete the Targos fedex quests more rapidly.
textpack=Fanmade Russian textupdates for some IWD mods.
weidu=WeiDU is needed for the installation and the recent WeiDU.exe must always be placed in the BG2 main directory.
widescreen=This mod allows you to play the game at any desired resolution. It can currently set your resolution to any X by Y, with X >= 800 and Y >= 600. Non-standard resolutions (E.G. 801 by 632) are not supported in fullscreen, but can work in windowed mode. BG cannot be forced to be windowed, but can work at all X by Y, with X >= 640 and Y >= 480.
