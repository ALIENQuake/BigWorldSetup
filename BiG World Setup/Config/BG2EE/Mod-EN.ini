angelo=Angelo Dosan is the fighter-turned-mage who served as your brother's henchman in Baldur's Gate. Most likely he didn't survive your game, but people in this world seem to have a knack for not staying dead. In the Angelo NPC Mod, Angelo tracks you down in the Graveyard District to make you an offer you can't refuse (though perhaps you will).
aranw=Aran Whitehand is a more 'self aware' human fighter and scribe for BG2, dual classable, so that he can be Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy... whatever your party needs. He has minor optional quests with a new area, but comes with no special weapons or upgradeable items - his specialty is in interacting with the members of the party and adapting to situations. This mod includes Faerunian swearing and occasional adult themes in the Romance portion.
arath=Arath is a complex, self-assured, humorous and somewhat hedonistic druid who, on the surface, cares for little else beyond himself and his love for nature. Possible romance or friendship-path, banters last from SoA to ToB.
arestorationp=This is a mod for Baldur's Gate 2 aiming to restore literally all unused sounds, as well as some minor cut characters or locations.

Your investigations cross paths with other interested parties, and the sparks will fly!||Back to Brynnlaw has extensive content for Imoen, so she is recommended but not required to accompany the party. Xan BG2 NPC also has extensive crossmod content with the mod.
banterpack=Adds dozens of new dialogs to all BioWare NPCs. Encloses, in addition, new inventions from January Jansen and dialogs with Lilarcor the speaking sword. (for SoA + ToB).
bg2_tweaks=This is a compilation of fixes, cosmetic changes, and tweaks.
BG2EE_GA=This patch provides German Sounds (e.g. in videos, dialogues, music) for your BG2EE-gane (until the translations are provided by the games developer).
bg2eear=This mod is an armor pack. There is a dwarf, Kurtz Goldenaxe, who is at Waukeen's Promenade, who will sell you these armors. Some of the armors are color variations of what you find in the game and some of them are new. The magical armors are expensive so you will have to save a lot of gold to buy them.
bg2eetp=This patch provides French, German, Italian or Spanish texts for your BG2EE-game (until the translations are provided by the games developer).
bg2eew=This mod is an weapon pack. There is a dwarf, Maltz, who is at Waukeen's Promenade, who will sell you these weapons. Some of the weapons are color variations of what you find in the game, some from BG2 and some of them are new. The magical weapons are expensive so you will have to save a lot of gold to buy them.
bp=BP balances all mods installed before, contains several smaller mods and includes other improvements also as a unique hostile KI system. If several mods have changed the same objects, these are overpowered. BP compensates this again. The AI of BP and Sword Coast Stratagems works on a different way: BP replaces some scripts from other mods by its own, SCS instead rewrites them. If you install both of them, SCS will rewrite some scripts that are already replaced by BP before and you may get unexpected results. Currently obviously the simplest choice would be to install only one of them.
bpseries=This mod adds more AI scripts for your party-members. The new scripts analyze the opponent and handle fights based on that outcome. By using hotkeys you can toggle the usage of buffs/summons, items, ranged/melee weapons, thieving skills and so on.

c#sb_silber=This mod enables to ask Adalon for somewhat of her blood, so that one can finish the human skin quest. This is thought for not-evil characters who want to get the informants, and afterwards deliver the evil armor in one of the temples.
c#solaufein=This modification makes Solaufein, the drow warrior from Usth Natha, a joinable NPC. Before the entrance to Adalon’s cave he is captured by the drow. Now it’s up to the HC to preserve Solaufein to be transformed into a drider!

coran=This mod adds Coran, a great archer and an infamous womanizer in BG1, as a fully developed NPC to BG2. He can be found in the Gate district of Athkatla, near the entrance. In ToB, Coran can also be summoned from the Pocket Plane Fate Spirit. Coran has a full friendship path with the PC, player-initiated dialogue and a number of banters with all Bioware NPCs.
d0questpack=This mod adds other adventures to BG2.
dace=Dace Linton is a chaotic neutral wiry bounty hunter.

dc=This mod adds 4 new areas, a few new items and some quests.
dearnise=The mod adds a romantic relationship between Nalia and a male player character who is human, elven, half-elven, or dwarven, of any character class and alignment. We don't know what happens if also "Arnel's Nalia Romance" is installed, but common sense suggests that at the very least, installing two dedicated PC/Nalia romances would be a poor idea.
derats_kits=This mod offers interesting specializations of the rarely performed'' pure'' classes (without multiclassing). Hence the term "unused".
dungeonbegone=This mod enables you to skip optionally Irenicus' Dungeon while still giving you loot and experience.

isra_bg2=Isra is a twenty-one year old paladin with the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, an order devoted to Sune Firehair. She has far more experience with (and sympathy for) the chaotic good churches of Sune and Lliira than any of the lawful churches, so her outlook and personality are somewhat removed from what you might expect from a paladin.|  |Isra can be found in the Den of the Seven Vales in Waukeen's Promenade, where she is looking into some family concerns. She will not immediately join the party, though you will have the chance to establish whether or not you knew her in BG1.

It also upgrades enemy challenges in special fights. Per default, only the Tactic-version will install the "Tactical Challenges" components of this mod.
