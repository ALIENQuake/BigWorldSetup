Click the button to the right to organize your translations.|||"Customization"|%sYou can alternatively choose one of the following BWS mod/component "pre-selections":|Minimal - This only adjusts the game so it can be modded in the future (there's no 'BG2EE Fixpack').||Recommended - A selection of mods focused on enhancing the game with well-integrated additions only.||Stable - A "maximized" selection with as many mods as possible, excluding components with known problems and difficult tactical challenges. Some of these mods include unbalanced items and will make the game less challenging.||Tactical - Like the Stable selection but with additional mods that make the game more challenging. This version is only for experienced players.||Expert - Also installs mods which have known problems or incompatibilities. This is for debugging by expert users only and is not intended for play. If you choose this version, you should know how IE programming and how to troubleshoot problems by yourself.|||If you want to customize the selection, be sure to click the button to the right. It is recommended to do this if you choose a Stable, Tactical, or Expert compilation.
