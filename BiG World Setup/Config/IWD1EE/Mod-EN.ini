[Description]
iwdnpc=The mod introduces a cast of five new characters to the great frozen wastes of the Forgotten Realms, with all the depth you would expect from companions. The mod will transform the Icewind Dale experience into the story of a single, player-defined protagonist, and his or her fully-interactive allies. ||The NPCs include a fighter, ranger, multi-classed thief, paladin, and bard. Alternate classes are also available. Each character comes with a new, original portrait, full voicing, interactions with the PC and each other, and quest commentary and interjections. Romance is also in the bitterly cold air... ||To start playing, you will have to install the mod, create your protagonist in the first slot, and import your companions alongside. Make sure to choose correct soundsets for them.
weidu=WeiDU is needed for the installation and the recent WeiDU.exe must always be placed in the BG2 main directory.
