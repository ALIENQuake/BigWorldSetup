### Supported mods ###

- Almost all of them! (use the Mod Request Template link above if there is a mod you want added)

### Installation Steps (also in the tool - read carefully!) ###

0. Quit all games and game editors
1. Disable your antivirus (only while you are installing - don't forget to re-enable it after!)
2. Disable User Account Control (if you don't do this, the automated installation can get stuck!)
3. Download Big World Setup zip archive and extract it anywhere you want (but not in your game folder!)
4. Execute "BiG World Setup.vbs" (this will auto-update to the latest version without overwriting local changes)
5. Optional: "BiG World Setup-Full-Update.vbs" (this will auto-update and destroy all local changes - be careful!)

### How do I contribute? ###

* learn git basics (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics)
* fork BWS repository using "SourceTree" or "SmartGit" or other preferred tool
* add mods/make other changes (see FAQ in the Docs folder of the BWS package!)
* create a pull request to submit changes from your fork back to the main project

! Don't use BitBucket's web-interface to edit files because it doesn't save non-ANSI characters properly
