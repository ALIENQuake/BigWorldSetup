**This application is outdated and it will be discontinued soon!**

### Getting started ###

1. [Download](<https://github.com/BigWorldSetup/BigWorldSetup/archive/master.zip>) Big World Setup zip archive and extract it anywhere you want (but not in your game folder!)
2. Close any open games and game editors to avoid interference with the installation process
3. Disable your antivirus (only while you are installing - don't forget to re-enable it after!)
4. Disable User Account Control (if you don't do this, the automated installation can get stuck!)
5. Execute "BWS.vbs"

*Optional: "BWS-NoAutoUpdate.vbs", this will skip the auto-update feature, use only when you modify BWS files or testing*
